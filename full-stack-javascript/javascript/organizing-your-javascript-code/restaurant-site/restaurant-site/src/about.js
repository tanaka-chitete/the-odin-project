  "For the past twelve years, nicola has been an eatery ever curious to learn and growâ€”to be the best that we can be. Our origin is rooted in an exploration of the natural world, which began with a simple desire to rediscover wild local ingredients by foraging and to follow the seasons.",
  "Since the early years, we have added many layers to what we do; we have teams dedicated only to innovation, another team is specialized in fermentation, we have full-time foragers, gardeners, and researchers. We've traveled the world in search of inspiration, technique, friendship, and new ingredients. Over the years we've grown our staff from a mere seven, to now more than thirty.",
  "Pursuit of knowledge, devout creativity, relentless teamwork, and surprising our guests are essential to who we are."
