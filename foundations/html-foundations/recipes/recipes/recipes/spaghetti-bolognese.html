    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Everyone needs a great everyday Spaghetti Bolognese recipe, and this is mine! The Bolognese Sauce is rich, thick and has beautiful depth of flavour. Itâ€™s perfect for a quick midweek meal but even better if you can simmer it for a couple of hours! Serve it over pasta, stuff into jacket potatoes, make an epic Lasagna or Baked Spaghetti Pie!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p><em>Serves 2</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>0.6 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>0.8 garlic cloves , minced</li>
        <li>0.4 onion , finely chopped (brown, yellow or white)</li>
        <li>0.4 lb / 200g combined beef and pork mince</li>
        <li>0.2 cup (50 ml) dry red wine</li>
        <li>0.8 beef bouillon cubes</li>
        <li>320g / 11.2 oz can crushed tomato (or tomato passata)</li>
        <li>0.8 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>0.8 tsp white sugar, if needed</li>
        <li>0.8 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>0.8 dried bay leaves</li>
        <li>0.8 sprigs fresh thyme (or 1/2 tsp dried thyme or oregano)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat oil in a large pot or deep skillet over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic, cook for 3 minutes or until light golden and softened.</li>
      <li>Turn heat up to high and add beef. Cook, breaking it up as your go, until browned.</li>
      <li>Add red wine. Bring to simmer and cook for 1 minute, scraping the bottom of the pot, until the alcohol smell is gone.</li>
      <li>Add remaining ingredients except salt and pepper. Stir, bring to a simmer then turn down to medium so it bubbles gently. Cook for 20 - 30 minutes (no lid), adding water if the sauce gets too thick for your taste. Stir occasionally.</li>
      <li>Adjust salt and pepper to taste right at the end. Serve over spaghetti - though if you have the time, I recommend tossing the sauce and pasta per steps below.</li>
    </ol>
